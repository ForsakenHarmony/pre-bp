# pre-bp
very small single-page app boilerplate


## a react app without react
React is great, but it's bigger than it needs to be to start a project. pre-bp
is boilerplate app based on [preact](https://preactjs.com/),
"a fast 3kB alternative to React with the same ES6 API."

## Switching later
pre-bp makes it simple to switch to react later if you want, but if you are
just looking for compatibilty with other react packages, try using
[preact-compat](https://preactjs.com/guide/switching-to-preact) (see aliasing).
